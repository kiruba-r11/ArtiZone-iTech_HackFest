## Abstract :scroll:

- *Artisans* mostly work in a `traditional unorganised sector` in which they are `vulnerable` to `exploitation and low wages`.


- We aim at improving the condition of our country's *Artisans* by enabling them to `sell their products on our website`. 


- We provide a `user-friendly interface` which requires `no prior knowledge of technology` so that the artisan can easily upload their product details.


- The end user can choose from a wide range of products. On purchase of a product, the Artisan receives the order and ships it via courier. 


- The package is delivered to the user's doorstep with ease. This encourages indigenous art work and also showcases the `talents of Indian Artisans`.
